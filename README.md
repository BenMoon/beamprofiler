There are a few limitations:

  * Glass windows: they need to be removed, including the window that is
    typically glued to the chip. Either break it with the chip pointing
    downwards or pull it out while heating the epoxy. This is dangerous
    and will void the camera's warranty. It will also make the chip
    very susceptible to dust and it will age much faster. But it it
    necessary: otherwise fringes will negatively impact image quality.
    Remember that even 1% stray light due to reflections from glass-air
    interfaces leads to 40% peak to peak variations in intensity.

  * ND filters -- reflective or volume absorptive need to be angled
    significantly to keep reflections from interfering at the chip.
    Those filters also need to be of good quality to not distort the
    beam.

  * With front-illuminated silicon chips, wavelengths longer than
    ~1050nm penetrate deeper into the chip and lead to long living
    excitations and smearing of the image along the vertical shift
    direction.

  * Above 1100nm and below 400nm, the quantum efficiency of Silicon
    chips is typically below 5%. Increased powers can destroy the chip
    or bleach it.

  * Monochrome chips are recommended. Otherwise the Bayer color filter
    pattern will skew results.
